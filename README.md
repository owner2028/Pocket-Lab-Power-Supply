## What it is:

A 4S Lithium Ion-based Battery Bank which can act as a portable Lab-Bench Power Supply. Designed for use with 4S lithium-ion battery packs.

## Features:

- Adjustable output voltage and current limit
- Battery powered
- USB-C/PD charging
- 8-Character 5x7 LED Matrix Display 
- Open hardware and firmware

## Repository Structure:

- `/hardware` - PCB, schematic, BOM, Gerbers, CAD
- `/firmware` - MCU firmware and utilities
- `/docs` - build guide, diagrams, images, notes (WIP)

## Documentation:

Coming soon!

## Safety Notice:

This project involves lithium-ion batteries and power electronics. Build and use at your own risk.

The PCB was designed for use with 4S battery packs. The BQ25792 will charge the pack up to 16.8V.

# IF YOU WANT TO USE ANOTHER CELL CONFIGURATION YOU MUST CHANGE THIS! OTHERWISE THE CELLS WILL BE OVERCHARGED AND DAMAGED!

Pin 20 (PROG) on the BQ25792 is the thing you need to adjust.
